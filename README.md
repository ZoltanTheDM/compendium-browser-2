## Details

Only the Gamemaster has access to the Settings, where they can enable or disable player access to specific tabs.

### Adding your own filters
You can add your own filter to by calling `game.compendiumBrowser.addSpellFilter`, `game.compendiumBrowser.addNpcFilter`, `game.compendiumBrowser.addFeatFilter`, and `game.compendiumBrowser.addItemFilter`. This does support any data that the spell or npc has, including flags.
